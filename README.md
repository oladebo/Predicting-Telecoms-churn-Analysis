### Data Source

- Amdari Project Predicting Customer Churn: Identifying Customers that are Susceptible to Churn

### Tools Used

- Python

### Import Required Libraries

- Loaded libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

### Data Collection

- Read the dataset from a CSV file using
- Initial Data Preview
- Viewed the top and bottom rows of the dataset
  
### Data Processing/Preparation

- Checked the shape (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
- Printed the number of rows and columns separately.
  
### EDA

- Showing the relation and distribution between the feature variables
  
### Model building

- Handling Missing value among the feature columns
- Handling imbalance dataset with method of using SMOTE
  
### Model Evaluation 

- using about 6 differennt machine learning algorithms to evaluate our prediction
  
### Recommendations/Insight

-  Also put it to production by uisng streamlit app with parameter to evaluation either to know customer that churn or Not churn
