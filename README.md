- Printed the number of rows and columns separately.
  
## EDA

- Showing the relation and distribution between the feature variables
  
### model building

- Handling Missing value among the feature columns
- Handling imbalance dataset with method of using SMOTE
  
### Model Evaluation 

- using about 6 differennt machine learning algorithms to evaluate our prediction
- 
### Recommendations

- Insight and recommendation
-  Also put it to production by uisng streamlit app with parameter to evaluation either to know customer that churn or Not churn
